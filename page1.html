            <h3>
                Cryptocurrency is a digital form of payment for goods and products. It is essentially a bank card that isn't tied down to any specific region or bank thus permitting it to be used anywhere at anytime.
            </h3>
            <p>
                Cryptocurrencies work using a technology called blockchain. Blockchain is a data stcuture that stores blocks of data. Every block is a group of transactions and it is immutable meaning that it can't be alterted. Even if a block was to be changed, the system would know as each block is interconnected to one anotehr though the vash value. A block stores the hash of the previous block and its curent hash in the header, thus creating the chain. The hash is a value that is generated using the data stored within the block therefore if a block's data was to be changed then the hash value would change. Due to the storage of the previous block's hash, the system will know that one of the block has been change and revert so that the correct block is put in place.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result, blockchains are immutable (meaning they can't be changed). As data can only be added on, a blockchain hold every data that has ever been added onto it and this can be found by traversing the chain. The first block is called the genesis block. Unlike banks, cryptocurrency is a based on a decentralised system where everyone has equal power therefore no one can have authority. This works via the Peer-to-Peer system where each computer is connected to one another. As a result, anyone can have access to the blockchain and add data to it.

            <p>
                The process of a data to be inputted into the blockchain starts of by placing the data at the bottom of a merkle tree. The data starts at the bottom and is hashed with other data until it reaches the top (which containes the hash of all the data in the tree). The hash of the previous block is also added to the current block and is then encrypted with the Public and Private key encryption. After that, the data is inserted into the blockchain.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to add data, a transaction must occur. There are 5 steps to create a transaction:
                <ul>
                    <li>1.  Initiate the transaction - Amount, User IDs (Alphanumerical code - 26 characters), Crypto wallet address (crypto coints, Private Key, Public key)</li>
                    <li>2.  Sign the transaction with Digital signature</li>
                    <li>3.  Broadcast</li>
                    <li>4.  Validation - Double spend sproblem check and Digital signature check (authentication)</li>
                    <li>5.  Gets added to the transaction pool</li>
                </ul>
